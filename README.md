# StrikeAIE

Comprehensive preparation guide for a full-stack AI Engineering role, covering:
- **Full-stack engineering** (frontend, backend, distributed systems, cloud)
- **AI engineering** (MCP, RAG, function calling, evals, agents, AI-as-judge, self-improving agents)
- **Managing non-deterministic AI outputs** in deterministic systems
- **Security-first design** (shift-left security, least-privilege IAM, secrets management)
- **Technical communication** for architecture decisions

## 📚 Documentation
