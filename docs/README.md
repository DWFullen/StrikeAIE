# AI Engineering Role Preparation Guide

This documentation will help you prepare for a full-stack AI Engineering role with focus on:
- Full-stack development
- AI engineering concepts and implementation
- Security-first design
- Technical communication

## Documentation Structure

1. **[Full-Stack Engineering](./full-stack-engineering.md)** - Frontend, backend, distributed systems, and cloud infrastructure
2. **[AI Engineering](./ai-engineering.md)** - MCP, RAG, function calling, evals, agent systems
3. **[Non-Deterministic Systems](./non-deterministic-systems.md)** - Managing AI outputs in deterministic systems
4. **[Security-First Design](./security-first-design.md)** - Shift-left security, IAM, secrets management
5. **[Technical Communication](./technical-communication.md)** - Architecture decisions and documentation
6. **[Hands-On Projects](./hands-on-projects.md)** - Practical exercises and implementations

## Study Approach

1. **Understand the fundamentals** - Start with core concepts in each area
2. **Build practical examples** - Implement small projects demonstrating each concept
3. **Practice communication** - Document your decisions and trade-offs
4. **Focus on security** - Consider security implications at every step
5. **Stay current** - AI engineering evolves rapidly, follow latest developments

## Recommended Study Order

For optimal preparation:
1. Start with Full-Stack Engineering basics (if rusty)
2. Dive into AI Engineering concepts
3. Study Security-First Design principles
4. Practice managing Non-Deterministic Systems
5. Work on Technical Communication skills
6. Complete Hands-On Projects to tie it all together

Good luck with your preparation!
